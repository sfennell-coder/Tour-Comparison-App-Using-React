Coding Project 19 | Tour Comparison App Using React

Developing a Tour Comparison App that showcases my ability to interact with APIs, manage state, and render components dynamically in React. This app will fetch tour data and display it, providing functionalities such as removing tours and toggling the visibility of detailed information.

In order to run app you must clone the app, through terminal you must type "cd demo" {enter} and then to run the folder you type "npm start" {enter}.
